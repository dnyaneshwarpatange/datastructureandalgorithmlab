Problem Statement 
A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility for adding new 
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to 
display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many 
maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary 
Search Tree for implementation.

Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using 
adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the 
graph. Identify the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on 
that.

search probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search 
tree that has the least search cost given the access probability for 
each key.

 Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, 
name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. 
Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist 
an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student 
details. Use sequential file to main the data.
